🔷 Gain Real-Time Insight into Your AWS System! 🔎

Are you ready to level up your AWS monitoring? 🔍 Here’s how to create a robust, automated system check solution for your compute resources on AWS! 🚀

🔹 Step 1: Aggregate Logs Using Kinesis Firehose
Start by streaming logs and event data from all your compute services—EC2, Lambda, Batch, ECS, and more—into Amazon Kinesis Firehose. This service funnels data into an S3 bucket at regular intervals, depending on your needs.

🔹 Step 2: Store Raw Data with S3
Set up an S3 bucket to store all data collected from Kinesis Firehose. To manage costs efficiently, apply a lifecycle policy to archive or delete old data based on your retention needs. This helps retain critical information while optimizing storage cost. Most logs can be deleted or moved to Glacier Deep Archive after a short while.

🔹 Step 3: Query and Analyze with Amazon Athena
Use Amazon Athena to query the data in S3, generating comprehensive reports on your system’s performance, usage, and trends. These reports provide critical insights to help you track and optimize your AWS environment.

🔹 Step 4: Output Athena Reports to an S3 Bucket
Configure Athena to output your query results into a designated S3 bucket. This allows you to centralize all performance data and access reports easily for further processing or analysis.

🔹 Step 5: Automate System Checks with Lambda
Set up a Lambda function to conduct check of the Athena report each time a new object displaced in the output bucket. If the report detects warnings or performance issues, the Lambda function triggers an Amazon SES notification to admins and/or a CloudWatch alarm, keeping your team informed of critical events.

🔹 Step 6: Visualize with Amazon QuickSight
Feed the data into Amazon QuickSight to create a dashboard for visual insights. This dashboard provides a near real-time, centralized view of your AWS system, making it easier to track trends and quickly address any issues.

💡 Why Use This Automated System Insight Setup?

This setup provides a clear, data-driven view of your entire AWS infrastructure, using lifecycle policies to keep data costs low and automated checks to alert you to any anomalies. By combining Kinesis, Athena, Lambda, and QuickSight, you create a comprehensive solution for monitoring AWS performance and health.
