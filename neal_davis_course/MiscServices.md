### Amazon Comprehend
Amazon Comprehend Medical is a natural language processing service that makes it easy to use machine learning to extract relevant medical information from unstructured text. Using Amazon Comprehend Medical, you can quickly and accurately gather information, such as medical conditions, medication, dosage, strength, and frequency from a variety of sources, like doctorsâ€™ notes, clinical trial reports, and patient health records.

You access Comprehend Medical through a simple API call, no machine learning expertise is required, no complicated rules to write, and no models to train.

You can use the extracted medical information and their relationships to build applications for use cases, like clinical decision support, revenue cycle management (medical coding), and clinical trial management. Because Comprehend Medical is HIPAA-eligible and can quickly identify protected health information (PHI), such as name, age, and medical record number, you can also use it to create applications that securely process, maintain, and transmit PHI.

### When SAML not supported
If your identity store is not compatible with SAML 2.0 then you can build a custom identity broker application to perform a similar function. The broker application authenticates users, requests temporary credentials for users from AWS, and then provides them to the user to access AWS resources.

The application verifies that employees are signed into the existing corporate network's identity and authentication system, which might use LDAP, Active Directory, or another system. The identity broker application then obtains temporary security credentials for the employees.

### NAT
You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. You are charged for creating and using a NAT gateway in your account.

###  Application Migration Service
AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) is the primary migration service recommended for lift-and-shift migrations to AWS. AWS encourages customers who are currently using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery to switch to AWS MGN for future migrations. AWS MGN enables organizations to move applications to AWS without having to make any changes to the applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers.

AWS Application Migration Service minimizes time-intensive, error-prone manual processes by automatically converting your source servers from physical, virtual machines, and cloud infrastructure to run natively on AWS.

Implementation begins by installing the AWS Replication Agent on your source servers. When you launch Test or Cutover instances, AWS Application Migration Service automatically converts your source servers to boot and runs natively on AWS.

### Using Cloud watch for creating alarms
* Create a CloudWatch alarm for that custom metric which invokes an action to restart the EC2 instance.
You can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your EC2 instances using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions. You can use the stop or terminate actions to help you save money when you no longer need an instance to be running. You can use the reboot and recover actions to automatically reboot those instances or recover them onto new hardware if a system impairment occurs.

AWS has an example of the implementation of Quota Monitor CloudFormation template that you can deploy on your AWS account. The template uses an AWS Lambda function that runs once every 24 hours. The Lambda function refreshes the AWS Trusted Advisor Service Limits checks to retrieve the most current utilization and quota data through API calls. Amazon CloudWatch Events captures the status events from Trusted Advisor. It uses a set of CloudWatch Events rules to send the status events to all the targets you choose during initial deployment of the solution: an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic or a Lambda function for Slack notifications.

### AWS AppSync (GraphQL)
AWS AppSync is a serverless GraphQL and Pub/Sub API service that simplifies building modern web and mobile applications. It provides a robust, scalable GraphQL interface for application developers to combine data from multiple sources, including Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and HTTP APIs.

### EFA and ENA
Amazon EC2 provides enhanced networking capabilities through the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA). It supports network speeds of up to 100 Gbps for supported instance types. Elastic Network Adapters (ENAs) provide traditional IP networking features that are required to support VPC networking.

An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is simply an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) with added capabilities. It provides all of the functionality of an ENA, with additional OS-bypass functionality. OS-bypass is an access model that allows HPC and machine learning applications to communicate directly with the network interface hardware to provide low-latency, reliable transport functionality.

The OS-bypass capabilities of EFAs are not supported on Windows instances. If you attach an EFA to a Windows instance, the instance functions as an Elastic Network Adapter without the added EFA capabilities.

### AWS Wavelength

### Network Firewall (VPC)
You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your Amazon VPC traffic in a number of ways, including the following:

- Pass traffic through only from known AWS service domains or IP address endpoints, such as Amazon S3.
- Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access.
- Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.
- Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, independent of the port used.

### AWS Resource Access Manager
AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is primarily used to securely share your resources across AWS accounts or within your Organization and not on a single AWS account. You also have to set up a custom IAM Policy in order for this to work.

### Amazon Lex
Amazon Lex enables you to build applications using a speech or text interface powered by the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa. Amazon Lex provides the deep functionality and flexibility of natural language understanding (NLU) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), so you can build highly engaging user experiences with lifelike conversational interactions and create new categories of products.

Amazon Lex enables any developer to build conversational chatbots quickly. With Amazon Lex, no deep learning expertise is necessaryâ€”to create a bot, you just specify the basic conversation flow in the Amazon Lex console. The console provides a graphical user interface that you use to build a production-ready bot for your application.
After you create a bot, you deploy it on one of the supported platforms or integrate it into your own application. When a user interacts with the bot, the client application sends requests to the bot using the Amazon Lex runtime API. For example, when a user says "I want to order pizza," your client sends this input to Amazon Lex using one of the runtime API operations. Users can provide input as speech or text.

Amazon Polly converts text into lifelike speech. It is designed for text-to-speech applications, not for conversational chatbots.
Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in texts. It is not used to build chatbot applications. (Sentiment Analysis)

### Aws Cloud Hub

### Athena Federated Query
If you have data in sources other than Amazon S3, you can use Athena Federated Query to query the data in place or build pipelines that extract data from multiple data sources and store them in Amazon S3. With Athena Federated Query, you can run SQL queries across data stored in relational, non-relational, object, and custom data sources.


AWS Systems Manager Run command is designed to run commands across a large group of instances without having to SSH into all your instances and run the same command multiple times. You can easily run the same command to all the managed nodes as part of the workload, without having to maintain access keys or individual access for each instance.


### Kinesis VS SQS

Kinesis

AWS Kinesis Streams enables large scale data ingestion and real-time processing of streaming data. It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order.

* Allows record size up to 1 MB
* Works at shard level not message level
* No auto scaling, developer needs to track shard usage and re-shard the Kinesis stream when necessary
* Limited read throughput (5 transactions per second per shard)
* Number of shards in a stream determines the maximum throughput
* Multiple consumers can be attached to a single stream, and each consumer can process every record individually (thanks to shard-iterators)
* No guranteee of delivery

SQS

AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable serverless hosted queue for storing messages and easily moving data between distributed application components.

* Allows relatively smaller message size up to 256 KB
* Each message can be processed independently
* Auto scales to dynamically increase read throughput by scaling the number of tasks reading from the queue
* Provides messaging semantics (such as message-level acknowledgment/fail) and message visibility timeout
* 120,000 limit for the number of inflight messages for a standard queue and 20,000 for a FIFO queue
* Atlease once deliverly guranted.
