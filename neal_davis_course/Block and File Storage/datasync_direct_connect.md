### Datasync Service
The most reliable and time-efficient solution that keeps the data secure is to use AWS DataSync and synchronize the data from the NAS device directly to Amazon S3. This should take place over an AWS Direct Connect connection to ensure reliability, speed, and security.

AWS DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) shares, Server Message Block (SMB) shares, self-managed object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems.

AWS DataSync can be used to move large amounts of data online between on-premises storage and Amazon S3 or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). 

DataSync eliminates or automatically handles many of these tasks, including scripting copy jobs, scheduling and monitoring transfers, validating data, and optimizing network utilization. The source datastore can be Server Message Block (SMB) file servers.
