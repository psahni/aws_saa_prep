In terms of EFS vs. FSx, the key attribute of the former is that it uses NFS, one of the first network file sharing protocols native to Unix and Linux. Windows has long provided an NFS client and server. Some Windows applications might not work on EFS or be feature-complete without access to a native Windows SMB file share.

As a Windows-based service, FSx runs the integrated SMB server built into the OS with storage built on NTFS and supports AD users, access control lists, groups and security policies, along with Distributed File System (DFS) namespaces and replication. These features enable FSx to support multi-AZ deployments using Microsoft's DFS, along with the ability to synchronize file shares in different AZs and configure automatic failovers. FSx supports other Windows security features, such as data encryption at rest and in transit, along with Amazon security services, such as network traffic control using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud security groups and user access policies with Identity and Access Management. FSx for Windows can log system events and API calls to CloudTrail for later auditing and analysis.
