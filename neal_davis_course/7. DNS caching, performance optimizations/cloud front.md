Amazon CloudFront can be used to cache the files in edge locations around the world and this will improve the performance of the webpages.

To serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3, you can deploy a CloudFront distribution using one of these configurations:

  • Using a REST API endpoint as the origin with access restricted by an origin access identity (OAI)

  • Using a website endpoint as the origin with anonymous (public) access allowed

  • Using a website endpoint as the origin with access restricted by a Referer header

### How a company in USA is expanding to Europe, but the backend must be in USA. How to keep the performance optimized for european users?
  - Use cloud front which can point to on premise server and cache data at edge locations

  - A custom origin can point to an on-premises server and CloudFront is able to cache content for dynamic websites. CloudFront can provide performance optimizations for custom origins even if they are running on on-premises servers. These include persistent TCP connections to the origin, SSL enhancements such as Session tickets and OCSP stapling.


  
### How to setup high availability for two buckets served from diff regions (cross-region replication)
You can set up CloudFront with origin failover for scenarios that require high availability. To get started, you create an origin group with two origins: a primary and a secondary. If the primary origin is unavailable or returns specific HTTP response status codes that indicate a failure, CloudFront automatically switches to the secondary origin.


### A company already using Auto scaling group behind ALB in Multi-AZ. How to handle sudden increase in traffic?

• Amazon Aurora Read Replicas can be used to serve read traffic which offloads requests from the main database.

• On the frontend an Amazon CloudFront distribution can be placed in front of the ALB and this will cache content for better performance and also offloads requests from the backend.

### Users take a lot of time to log into their website. There are also occasions when their users are getting HTTP 504 errors. (Performance + Authentication)
* It is already mentioned in the problem that company is using cloud front.

Solutions:-
 Set up an origin failover by creating an origin group with two origins. Specify one as the primary origin and the other as the second origin which CloudFront automatically switches to when the primary origin returns specific HTTP status code failure responses.

### Block countries to access the content due to copyright issues

When a user requests your content, CloudFront typically serves the requested content regardless of where the user is located. If you need to prevent users in specific countries from accessing your content, you can use the CloudFront geo restriction feature to do one of the following:

  • Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the countries on a whitelist of approved countries.

  • Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned countries.

For example, if a request comes from a country where, for copyright reasons, you are not authorized to distribute your content, you can use CloudFront geo restriction to block the request.

This is the easiest and most effective way to implement a geographic restriction for the delivery of content.


### Company Needs to Send files to users and want to reduce data transfer costs

Lambda@Edge is a feature of Amazon CloudFront that lets you run code closer to users of your application, which improves performance and reduces latency. Lambda@Edge runs code in response to events generated by the Amazon CloudFront.

You simply upload your code to AWS Lambda, and it takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability at an AWS location closest to your end user.

In this case Lambda@Edge can compress the files before they are sent to users which will reduce data egress costs.



### Origin Group
You can also set up CloudFront with origin failover for scenarios that require high availability. An origin group may contain two origins: a primary and a secondary. If the primary origin is unavailable or returns specific HTTP response status codes that indicate a failure, CloudFront automatically switches to the secondary origin. To set up origin failover, you must have a distribution with at least two origins.

Take note that we can also use an EC2 instance or a custom origin in configuring CloudFront. To achieve high availability in an EC2 instance, we need to deploy the instances in two or more Availability Zones. You also need to configure the instances to be part of the origin group to ensure that the application is highly available.
