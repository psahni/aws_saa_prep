### Trivia: Main website + 1 secondry static website (Failover routing policy)

The most cost-effective solution is to create a static website using an Amazon S3 bucket and then use a failover routing policy in Amazon Route 53. With a failover routing policy users will be directed to the main website as long as it is responding to health checks successfully.

If the main website fails to respond to health checks (its down), Route 53 will begin to direct users to the backup website running on the Amazon S3 bucket. Itâ€™s important to set the TTL on the Route 53 records appropriately to ensure that users resolve the failover address within a short time.

###  Geolocation routing policy

If you need to serve content to users belonging to specific region from a specific region then use this policy.

To protect the distribution rights of the content and ensure that users are directed to the appropriate AWS Region based on the location of the user, the geolocation routing policy can be used with Amazon Route 53.

Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, meaning the location that DNS queries originate from.

When you use geolocation routing, you can localize your content and present some or all of your website in the language of your users. 

-> You can also use geolocation routing to restrict distribution of content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights.
