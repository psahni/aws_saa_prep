### WAF
* AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP(S) requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API.

* Web ACLs â€“ You use a web access control list (ACL) to protect a set of AWS resources. You create a web ACL and define its protection strategy by adding rules. Rules define criteria for inspecting web requests and specify how to handle requests that match the criteria. You set a default action for the web ACL that indicates whether to block or allow through those requests that pass the rules inspections.

* AWS WAF is easy to deploy and protect applications deployed on either Amazon CloudFront as part of your CDN solution, the Application Load Balancer that fronts all your origin servers, Amazon API Gateway for your REST APIs, or AWS AppSync for your GraphQL APIs. There is no additional software to deploy, DNS configuration, SSL/TLS certificate to manage, or need for a reverse proxy setup.

* With AWS Firewall Manager integration, you can centrally define and manage your rules and reuse them across all the web applications that you need to protect.
*  AWS Firewall Manager is mainly used to simplify your AWS WAF administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources.

### AWS Network Firewall

AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that is primarily used to deploy essential network protections for all of your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and not particularly to your Application Load Balancers. Take note that the AWS Network Firewall is account-specific by default and needs to be integrated with the AWS Firewall Manager to easily share the firewall across your other AWS accounts. In addition, refactoring the web application will require an immense amount of time.
