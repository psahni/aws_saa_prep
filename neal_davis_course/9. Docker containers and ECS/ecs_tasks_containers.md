### IAM roles AND ECS

* ECS tasks have IAM tasks, which enable an ecs task to call aws servives api

* You can associate an IAM role with an Amazon ECS task definition.

* You can specify a task IAM role in your task definitions, or you can use a "taskRoleArn" override when running a task manually with the RunTask API operation. 

*  The Amazon ECS agent receives a payload message for starting the task with additional fields that contain the role credentials. 

*  Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials to the containers or using the Amazon EC2 instanceâ€™s role, you can associate an IAM role with an Amazon ECS task definition or RunTask API operation.
