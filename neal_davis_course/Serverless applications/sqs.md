### Scaling based on Amazon SQS

You can scale your auto scaling group in response to the load in SQS queues

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html


### SQS causing delays in processing orders
The most likely cause of the processing delays is insufficient instances in the middle tier where the order processing takes place. The most effective solution to reduce processing times in this case is to scale based on the "backlog per instance"(number of messages in the SQS queue) as this reflects the amount of work that needs to be done.


### Trivia: How to assign permssion to AWS account to send messages to SQS queue

Update the permission policy on the SQS queue to grant the sqs:SendMessage permission to the partnerâ€™s AWS account


### Basic examples of Amazon SQS policies

Example 1: Grant one permission to one AWS account

```
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Id": "Queue1_Policy_UUID",
   "Statement": [{
      "Sid":"Queue1_SendMessage",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
         "AWS": [ 
            "111122223333"
         ]
      },
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:444455556666:queue1"
   }]  
}
```

### Trivia:

Q. A new application will run across multiple Amazon ECS tasks. Front-end application logic will process data and then pass that data to a back-end ECS task to perform further processing and write the data to a datastore. The Architect would like to reduce-interdependencies so failures do no impact other components.

A. This is a good use case for Amazon SQS. SQS is a service that is used for decoupling applications, thus reducing interdependencies, through a message bus. The front-end application can place messages on the queue and the back-end can then poll the queue for new messages. Please remember that Amazon SQS is pull-based (polling) not push-based (use SNS for push-based).

### Prioritization based queues
AWS recommend using separate queues when you need to provide prioritization of work. The logic can then be implemented at the application layer to prioritize the queue for the paid photos over the queue for the free photos.

### Decouples architecture

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF) are the services that you can use for creating a decoupled architecture in AWS. Decoupled architecture is a type of computing architecture that enables computing components or layers to execute independently while still interfacing with each other.

Amazon SQS offers reliable, highly-scalable hosted queues for storing messages while they travel between applications or microservices. Amazon SQS lets you move data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components. Amazon SWF is a web service that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components.
