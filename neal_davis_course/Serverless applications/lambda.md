AWS Lambda supports many AWS services as event sources. For more information, see Using AWS Lambda with other services. When you configure these event sources to trigger a Lambda function, the Lambda function is invoked automatically when events occur. You define event source mapping, which is how you identify what events to track and which Lambda function to invoke.
