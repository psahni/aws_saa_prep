### NAT for Public Addresses

Network address translation. Ec2 instance has no knowledge about the public/elastic ip of the instance
It is associated externally through internet gateway

### Working with ENI and IP Addresses
(Very good lecture and hands one - worth to re watch later)
Author creates a ENI with subnet.
This ENI can be attached to the instance in the same AZ.

You associate an Elastic IP to an instance
You can re-associate it to ENI, then you can associate that ENI to an instance.
    - Detach ENI from the prev instance also and then attach to your 2nd instance
Now your new Instance will have one public that is the elastic IP attached to ENI
You need to stop and start the instance to see the effects.

After you are done, you can diassociate the IP addr from ENI
You can release the IP from Elastic IPs
Then you can delete the ENI and then instances
