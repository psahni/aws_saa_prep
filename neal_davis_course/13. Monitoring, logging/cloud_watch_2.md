### Cloud Watch Logs

- You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources.

- CloudWatch Logs enables you to "centralize" the logs from all of your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service. You can then easily view them, search them for specific error codes or patterns, filter them based on specific fields, or archive them securely for future analysis. CloudWatch Logs enables you to see all of your logs, regardless of their source, as a single and consistent flow of events ordered by time.

Keywords - Centralized, search, filter, archive, query

- CloudWatch Logs also supports querying your logs with a powerful query language, auditing and masking sensitive data in logs, and generating metrics from logs using filters or an embedded log format.
