### Engress Intrernet Gateway (IPv6)

Q. A payment processing company plans to migrate its on-premises application to an Amazon EC2 instance. An IPv6 CIDR block is attached to the company’s Amazon VPC. Strict security policy mandates that the production VPC must only allow outbound communication over IPv6 between the instance and the internet but should prevent the internet from initiating an inbound IPv6 connection. The new architecture should also allow traffic flow inspection and traffic filtering.

* IPv6 addresses are globally unique and are therefore public by default. If you want your instance to be able to access the internet, but you want to prevent resources on the internet from initiating communication with your instance, you can use an egress-only internet gateway.


* In this scenario, you can use an egress-only internet gateway to allow outbound IPv6 communication to the internet and then use the AWS Network Firewall to set up the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering.

### AWS Network Firewall


AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy essential network protections for all of your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The service can be set up with just a few clicks and scales automatically with your network traffic, so you don't have to worry about deploying and managing any infrastructure. AWS Network Firewall includes features that provide protection from common network threats.

AWS Network Firewall’s stateful firewall can incorporate context from traffic flows, like tracking connections and protocol identification, to enforce policies such as preventing your VPCs from accessing domains using an unauthorized protocol. AWS Network Firewall’s intrusion prevention system (IPS) provides active traffic flow inspection so you can identify and block vulnerability exploits using signature-based detection. AWS Network Firewall also offers web filtering that can stop traffic to known bad URLs and monitor fully qualified domain names.
