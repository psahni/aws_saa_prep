* STS service

EC2 AssumeRole API call

AWS provides AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) as a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for users.

The Security Token Service allows for temporary credentials to be used with identity federation, delegation, cross-account access, and IAM roles

AWS Security Token Service (STS) is the service that you can use to create and provide trusted users with temporary security credentials that can control access to your AWS resources. Temporary security credentials work almost identically to the long-term access key credentials that your IAM users can use.

* Using AWS Cognito to issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is incorrect because the Amazon Cognito service is primarily used for user authentication and not for providing access to your AWS resources. A JSON Web Token (JWT) is meant to be used for user authentication and session management.
