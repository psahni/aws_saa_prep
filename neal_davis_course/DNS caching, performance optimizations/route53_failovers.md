### Trivia: Main website + 1 secondry static website

The most cost-effective solution is to create a static website using an Amazon S3 bucket and then use a failover routing policy in Amazon Route 53. With a failover routing policy users will be directed to the main website as long as it is responding to health checks successfully.

If the main website fails to respond to health checks (its down), Route 53 will begin to direct users to the backup website running on the Amazon S3 bucket. Itâ€™s important to set the TTL on the Route 53 records appropriately to ensure that users resolve the failover address within a short time.
