### Fault-tolerant systems

Fault-tolerant systems are designed to continue operating properly even when one or more of their components fail. The main goal of fault tolerance is to prevent system failures from causing data loss or interruption of service. Here are some key aspects of fault-tolerant systems:

#### Redundancy: 

Multiple identical components are used so that if one fails, others can take over.

#### Error detection: 
The system can identify when a fault has occurred.

#### Error recovery: 
The ability to recover from errors and continue operation.

#### Isolation: 
Faulty components are isolated to prevent the spread of errors.

#### Graceful degradation: 
The system continues to function, possibly with reduced performance, rather than failing completely.

#### Some common applications of fault-tolerant systems include:

* Data centers and cloud computing infrastructure
* Aircraft and aerospace systems
* Financial and banking systems
* Telecommunications networks
* Critical infrastructure (power grids, water systems)

Fault-tolerant design often involves trade-offs between cost, complexity, and reliability. The level of fault tolerance required depends on the criticality of the system and the potential consequences of failure.
