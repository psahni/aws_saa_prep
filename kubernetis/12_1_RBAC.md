Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a crucial security mechanism that manages authorization for the Kubernetes API. Here's an overview of how RBAC works in Kubernetes:

### 1. Core concepts:

- Subjects: Entities requesting access (users, groups, or service accounts)
- Resources: API objects being accessed (pods, services, deployments, etc.)
- Verbs: Actions performed on resources (get, list, create, update, delete, etc.)

### 2. RBAC API objects:

- Role: Defines permissions within a specific namespace
- ClusterRole: Defines cluster-wide permissions
- RoleBinding: Links subjects to roles within a namespace
- ClusterRoleBinding: Links subjects to cluster roles across the entire cluster

### 3. How it works:

1. Define Roles/ClusterRoles with specific permissions
2. Create RoleBindings/ClusterRoleBindings to associate subjects with roles
3. Kubernetes API server checks RBAC policies for each request
4. Access is granted only if the subject has the necessary permissions

### 4. Example workflow:

- Create a Role:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

- Create a RoleBinding:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

This setup allows user "jane" to read pods in the default namespace.

5. Best practices:

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use namespaces to isolate resources and permissions
- Regularly audit and review RBAC policies
- Use groups for easier management of multiple users
- Leverage default roles and cluster roles when appropriate
